			his is a reflection for Unit 2. <br>
			This quarter, I have learned basic tags and linking that are key to web designing and basic requirements. I think the video project was very interesting to do. If I had more time I think the outcome would be much better but overall it was a learning experience. I had some trouble with adding the video and poster because the poster was not contained and I think that is something I need to work on.
			<br> </p>
			<p> Here is a list of things I found particularly interesting: </p>
		
			<li>File management in pre-coding.</li>
			<li>Listing in HTML consist of ordered lists and unordered lists, for this list I chose to use an unordered list.</LI>
			<li>Video placing and the poster in the correct size is important to a web  page.</li>
